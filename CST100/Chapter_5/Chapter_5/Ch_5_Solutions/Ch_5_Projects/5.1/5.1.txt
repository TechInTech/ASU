For ArrayBag and LinkedBag, the == operation is O(1) in the best case, when

1. The two bags are identical.
2. The second argument (other) is not the same type as self.
3. The two bags do not have the same length.

Otherwise, the worst-case and average running times are O(m * n), for two bags of lengths m and n, because the in operator, which is linear over n, is run m times.
